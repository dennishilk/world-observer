# global-reachability-score

## Purpose
This observer is a placeholder module intended to collect passive, publicly
observable signals related to **global-reachability-score**. It does not perform scanning,
probing, or active measurements.

## Output
The observer emits JSON with a timestamp, observer name, and a results object.
The results are intentionally empty until passive data sources are approved and
implemented.

## Configuration
A placeholder configuration file is provided for future, non-invasive data
source references.
