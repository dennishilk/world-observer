# Methodology

## Passive Measurement Principles
World Observer collects only passive, publicly observable signals. Observers do
not initiate network connections, scan hosts, or probe services. Instead, they
rely on data that is already visible to the public or produced by routine,
non-invasive observation pipelines.

## Why Repetition Matters
Long-term stability requires repeatable measurement. The project emphasizes
consistent cadence and unchanged semantics so that comparisons across months or
years remain meaningful. Repetition reduces noise, helps identify structural
changes, and supports cautious, evidence-based interpretation.

## Limitations
- **No active verification**: Passive observation can miss issues that require
  direct probing to confirm.
- **Signal ambiguity**: Public signals can be delayed, incomplete, or biased by
  external factors.
- **Ethical constraints**: The project prioritizes non-interference, which
  constrains what can be measured.

These limits are intentional. The goal is to establish a durable, ethically
sound baseline rather than to maximize coverage through aggressive techniques.
