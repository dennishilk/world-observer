# Ethics

## What This Project Does **Not** Do
- No exploitation or intrusion.
- No scanning, probing, or brute-force activity.
- No collection of private or non-public data.
- No interference with network operations.

## Legal and Ethical Boundaries
World Observer is confined to passive, publicly observable signals. The project
avoids any activity that could reasonably be interpreted as intrusive or
harmful. Any future data source must be publicly accessible, non-invasive, and
lawful in the jurisdiction where the observation is conducted.

## Observation, Not Interference
The project is intentionally conservative. Its purpose is to document long-term
patterns of reachability and silence, not to alter or test the networks being
observed. Observation is carried out with respect for privacy, stability, and
legal constraints.
